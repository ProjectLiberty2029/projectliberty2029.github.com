:page-todos: Complete this. It means adding potential names (more the better) for each of the cabinet-level agencies. The most important to get early to give a sense of where this plan is envisioning the government heading are Secretary of State (international affairs), Secretary of Defense (military), Secretary of Homeland Security (reforming ICE and border protection, etc), and Attorney General (how to reestablish Justice). The next tier to attack are Secretary of Treasure (finance), Secretary of Commerce (business), and Director of ROLA (Formerly DOGE, Formerly US Digital Services)

## SUMMARY
While it is not possible to name exact, final appointees, it may be a useful exercise to discuss publicly the sorts of out-of-the-box choices a PG2029 appointment process will require. 

## Vice President
While elected, our process allows the Presidential candidate to effectively install the Vice President of their choice. +

This choice must be whoever seems most likely to help win the General Election. +

"Chemistry" with the Presidential candidate and with the Democratic Party needs to be a secondary concern.  

## Secretary of State:
Top Choice: Former President Barack Obama: 

The primary disadvantages of his selection will include the following:

. Political overshadowing of the new President. 
. MAGA loyalists will be motivated to continue their scorched earth campaigns opposing PG2029.

The primary advantages of his selection will include the following:

. Internationally, he will lend credibility to the narrative we must use with our erstwhile allies that the US is firmly repudiating the MAGA priorities of the DJT era. 
. Both Domestically and Internationally, his immense experience will make in an invaluable assistant to a President who will be heavily engaged in domestic PG2029. 
. He can also be deployed domestically to assist PG2029 in the legitimate role of explaining our post-MAGA construction to the country as an explanation to Americans of how the USA is explaining itself abroad.  
. During confirmation, he can legitimately employ the stratagem of deferring difficult questions from any MAGA Republicans on the Senate Committee on Foreign Relations in two ways: 
.. Either as irrelevant because they might be questioning previous domestic policies, or
.. as requiring closed-door answers because of sensitivity of the material: practically any area of difficult questioning can be handled in this way.
