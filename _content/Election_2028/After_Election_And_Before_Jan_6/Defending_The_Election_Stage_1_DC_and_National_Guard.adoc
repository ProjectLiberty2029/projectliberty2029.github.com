Assuming the election has been won in November 2028 for a Democratic President and Vice President, 
there is the real possibility of the outgoing DJT, MAGA, and Project2025 regime ('the MAGA regime') to employ
extreme measures to retain power. 

This warning asks the reader to remember how far-fetched the idea of a mob taking over, even temporarily,
the Capital during January 6th, 2021. 

This warning asks the reader to consider what the following moves by the present regime portend:

. Use of the National Guard to control Washington DC beginning in August of 2025. 
. The subsequent arming of those troops. 
. The use of federal forces, including the Marines, in Los Angeles in July 2025.
. The President's political address to troops on June 11, 2025 in which hand-selected troops jeered 
the perceived enemies of the MAGA regime. 

These actions demonstrate effective sorting of the military into personnel who are loyal enough to the 
MAGA regime to allow themselves to follow what would otherwise be considered obviously illegal orders. 

Such orders could include preventing those accused of 'stealing' the election in 2028 from taking their 
rightful seats in Congress on January 3rd, 2029, and executing their duty to faithfully count the electors 
on January 6th 2029 and declare the actual winner of the election the incoming President of the United States. 

The motivation for issuing such orders will include fear of prosecution for the many crimes of the MAGA regime. 

Washington DC is unique in the US
