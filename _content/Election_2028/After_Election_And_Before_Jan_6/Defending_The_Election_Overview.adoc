## Overview

This document and section of ProjectLiberty2029 assumes we will win both Popular and Electoral vote counts on Nov 7, 2028.  It is probable that the margin of victory will be large. 

Nonetheless, we must expect DJT, JD Vance, MAGA, and Project 2025 backers to attempt to 'steal' the election by court challenges prior to certification of Electoral College votes. We must expect that they will not only use legal and quasi-legal strategies, but illegal strategies. 

It is ironic that we must prepare to defend against a stolen election post-election day since this is the original "Big Lie" told by Donald Trump. 

All their strategies, and especially their illegal strategies, will be bolstered by the presence of over 1,500 pardoned January 6th rioters who Trump and JD Vance and whoever was the Republican Candidate for President can call on to aid the attempts to steal the election.  They will also be bolstered by MAGA loyal members of the military and the National Guard. 

The calendar of dates will be expanded in another document as the electoral landscape comes into clearer focus.  

The summary of the most important national dates is this:

. General Election date is Tuesday, November 7th, 2028.
. Electors meet on the first Tuesday following the second Wednesday in December, which will be December 19, 2028. 
. The safe-harbor deadline for certificates from each state to be in Washington DC is the fourth Wednesday, which will be December 27, 2028.
. The 121st Congress will be convened on January 3rd, 2029. This is a critical deadline because failure to seat sufficient members who are not loyal to MAGA enables more possibilities for stealing the election. 
. The counting of the Electoral College votes happens in a joint session of congress on January 6th, 2029. 

We will need large teams of lawyers, support staff, and security empowered to represent the President Elect ahead of each of these dates.  

It is probable that the Democratic party and many volunteer and paid lawyers will be available for these tasks. 

We should expect to call on the public to help with security. Masses of people at important events, accompanying and witnessing these teams of legal experts, will be crucial to avoiding bloodshed by bad-actors. This includes both those officially sanctioned and employed by the current regime, and those with quasi-affiliation, like the Proud Boys, other organized militias, pardoned Jan 6ers, etc.) 

Planning must be done by the Democratic Party, and by the Presidential Candidate, and by state governorships to have duplicate teams established in advance and prepared for cases of individuals and groups being arrested, waylaid, injured or even murdered. 

We call for that planning here in these lines.  

However, unlike the rest of ProjectLiberty2029, the specifics of that redundancy and security planning is akin to war-planning and should not be public.  

We should nonetheless explore possibilities here in an attempt to 'game-out' and prepare the public to participate, to protect, and otherwise support the teams working to prevent stealing of the election.
