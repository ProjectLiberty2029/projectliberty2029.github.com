We must clearly articulate the plans which shall compromise the actual Plans for Project 2029. (We need to remember that this project here at ProjectLiberty2029 is a grass-roots version of what shall be Project 2029.)

This is important to give us the largest possible vote for repudiating the DJT, MAGA, Project 2025 regime. 

Even if Democrats cannot win the electoral votes from Republican states, we must reduce the voter suppression that arises because the Electoral College makes voters in a state whose electors are all-but-certain to go for the opposing candidate less enthusiastic about voting. 

We must articulate the country the inevitable truth that only a Democratic Party nominee for President can marshall enough electoral votes to become President after the regime of DJT and JD Vance. 

By articulating the positive agenda stipulated here in ProjectLiberty2029, we will encourage Democratic voter participation even in "Red" states.  

We need to articulate also the danger: that DJT, JD Vance, MAGA Republicans, and those behind Project 2025 will attempt to negate the results of the 2028 election using the playbook from 2020, but with years to plan and with JD Vance as Vice President instead of Mike Pence. 

The vote must be as overwhelming as possible in order to peel away as much support of MAGA and Project 2025 backers as possible. (These numbers may be small, but certain individuals like Billionaires can make a big difference.)
