We need a table here of the Secretary of State elections being waged in 2026 and State Governorship elections in states where the Governor appoints the Secretary of State. 

This table needs to include the "Red/Blue" leaning of each state. 

It should be sortable.

It needs to be initially sorted by a priority that puts higher importance of controlling the counting of the 2028 races in swing and swingy states, and progressively lesser importants on progressively less 'swingy' and less winnable races. 

This priority needs to be mindful of no losing "leaning Blue" Secretaries of States and/or the Governors who appoint them.
