= Overview

This page explains in a non-technical way the overall software environment within which this project works. 
This is meant to help inform those helping out as to why things are happening the way the are happening. 

Reading this document isn't necessary to your contributing, but it might help ease any learning curve. 

== GitHub vs. Other Wiki sites. 

We chose GitHub because it is designed for large-scale development with very granular changed tracking and robust security tools. 
These have been road-tested in at-scale industries which are under continual attack by not only individuals but state-level actors.

Security is the main reason for using GitHub over other platforms. 
For example, MediaWiki is the software that drives Wikipedia, but it must be set up on a server, which means having the strength to resist attacks by all manner of opponents to ProjectLiberty2029 becomes an issue. 
is a possible alternative, but that is a suite of software that would need to be hosted, and that hosting raises the issues of security against large-scale attacks. 

== Hosting Overview

Project Liberty 2029 Wiki is hosted on GitHub. 

GitHub the name comes from "Git" the software protocol, which is a suite of tools developed by and for computer programmers to help them manage large and distributed software development projects. 

GitHub provides hosting under the name GitHub Pages. 
These are "static" website pages, meaning they do not allow programs to run on the website to provide things like product lookups, or pricing calculators, etc.
They do this to keep their system secure and scalable. 

Website pages are sent to people's internet browsers using what is called HTML, which stands for "Hyper-Text Markup Language."
HTML is so cumbersom for humans to write, that we have a whole separate set of programs to write it for us. 
But that means we need to write in a format that the converters can read. 

The most widely used input format is Asciidoc. 

One would think that converters would be set up to take Word, Google Docs, LibreOffice, etc, file formats, but they do not for reasons beyond this text. 
One would also think that Word, Google Docs, LibreOffice, etc, could write Asciidoc files (since they can write html). 
Sadly, this is not the case. 

Therefore, we have set up ProjectLiberty2029's GitHub Actions to create the HTML files from asciidoc input files. 
The program that does this conversion is called Jekyll. 
Jekyll not only reads and processes the instructions on our pages that are written in Asciidoc, but it also reads a programming language called Liquid. 

Fortunately, the only thing you will need to know as a contributor is how to write in Asciidoc. 

== Workflow Requirements

We have two main requirements: 1) clarity, and 2) credibility. 

=== Clarity requirement

For Clarity, we will want to present to the world straighforward legislation and proposals which are a simple as possible for the task at hand of restoring Liberty and Justice in America.

In order to do that, we are choosing the simplest project history format: "linear commit history." 

The only word in that phrase that may be unfamiliar is the word 'commit.'

A commit has two meanings here: 1) it is a single save point of a document, and 2) it is a collection of save points. 

What you will notice working in GitHub on the Website interface, is that every time you want to "save" a document, you must "Commit Changes" and give a text explanation of what you were changing. 

If you work in GitHub Desktop, you will be able to simultaneously change many files, and save them without making a commit. 
Then you make a single "commit" for all those changes together. 

== Credibility requirement

For Credibility, we will need to be sure our processes are secure from bad-actors making unauthorized changes. 

Therefore we will require a small group of maintainers to make digitally signed commits to the main branch of the ProjectLiberty2029 project. 

We will not require digitally signed commits from Contributors, because the process is onerous. 
(It requires several command line steps to setup the necessary encryption keys, and then ongoing command line processes to make linear commits to the main branch.)




== How to Write in Asciidoc?



== Workaround for learning Asciidoc

There is link:https://github.com/admin-shell-io/word2asciidoc/issues/new?template=transform-word-to-asciidoc-issue.yml["an online converter that may convert Word documents to Asciidoc,", window=read-later,opts="noopener,nofollow"] but results have not been tested. 


Our workflow will involve adding and changing documents. 
These documents are written in what is known as Asciidoc Markdown Language. 


GitHub provides a workflow that lets us copy-over or copy-down existing documents, modify, push-up (if we copied down, or if we created a new document locally), and finally request pull-back into the master version. 

The all-important pull-back/into stage allows for robust discussion by a group before making the changes.  
All changes are automagically documented line-by-line with what was changed and added. 
At the end, that permanent line-by-line record of the changes that were made. 

In many ways it is an ideal crowd-sourced legislative amendment environment. 

== Workflow overview


In order to maintain 

Because the 'work' of making changes & additions is meant to be done separate from the master version of the project, most people do this work 'locally,' meaning on their computer. 

GitHub offers a "GitHub Desktop" program that allows us to avoid using command-line work, and do our processes with button-pushing instead. 
This program is tightly integrated with VS Code.
These things mean that the context for this and other how-to documents will be working inside VS Code.

If you very much do not want to learn VS Code (it is, indeed, a mouthful of learning) you can work inside any text editor. 
Be careful if using a program like Word or Open Office or on-line editors like Google-docs, et. al, because they will add formatting information to their output that will mess-up this workflow. 
When using those programs, look for an asciidoc output or a plain text output. 

We have been using and encourage you to use .adoc as the extension on your filenames. 
This signals the programs to read it with asciidoc syntax. 
There are many other extensions that will also work including .ad, .asc, and .asciidoc. 

== Processing Overview 

Once any change or set of changes are pulled over to the main branch of ProjectLiberty2029, any asciidoc files included will be used by a GitHub Actions stack of programs to write the final html files that the rest of the world can see. 

Most of what we will be modifying will be these asciidocs, because they contain the words we are communicating to the world on how to restore and re-secure Freedom and Justice to America. 

=== Why asciidoc?

This may have been your first question, but it needed this much explanation to understand the answer. 

Because we are passing documents with changes back and forth, we need a very standardized format so that computers can readily figure out for us what exactly has changed. 

Ever gotten a rental agreement or employment contract back after a discussion and you're wondering where in there it might have been changed?! 
This standard document form and GitHub insure that we're all informed as to what is changing. 

The industry standard tool for this is Asciidoc. 
There are a ton of videos and courses on it.
Librarians use it. 
So if you need help, there are plenty of resources for learning it. 

If you know markdown, you can use it, because asciidoc includes it.

= Asciidoc basics: 

== Front matter

All Asciidocs must start with an = followed by the Document Title. In this document, that looks like = Sample Document

The very next line begins a bunch of special words that are in the form of :showtitle: or :page-authors: and so forth. 
These are called *document attributes.*

All the documents in this project should have at least the document attributes included with this document with one exception. 
That exception is the :showtitle: attribute: it is a personal preference whether you want it to display at the top of your pages. 
However, because the '= Document Title' _is still required,_ it will always display on the Wiki homepage. 

Here are the other document attributes and what they do for us: 

. Static-do not change or it will break something:
.. :doctype: book ... This is needed to insure the formatting works as expected. 
.. :table-caption: Data Set ... This allows the pages to display captions on tables. 
.. :imagesdir: /Media/Images/ ... This allows the website to find any images we are hosting. It also tells you where to put images you wish to add. You can add sub-directories for images and you'll find examples of that in this document. 
. Things you are meant to change: 
. :page-draft_complete: ... Valid values are 0%, 25%, 50%, 75% and 100% and <</Page_Draft_Status.adoc#,are defined here.>> This status appears in the upper left-hand corner of the page when displayed on a computer. Phones do not display this panel, unless you switch to desktop mode. 
. :page-stage: ... Valid values are 0 through 10 and <</Stages_Defined.adoc#,are described here.>> These stages will cause the document to automatically appear in the "Staged Needs" section of the index page. 
. :page-authors: ... Here you can let us know who you are so the community knows who ask questions. This can be any text, and you can leave it blank. If included, this displays in the left-hand pane under the table of contents. Phones do not display this panel, unless you switch to desktop mode. 
.. :page-todos: ... Here you can type any text to indicate the next steps needed for your document. It appears in the left hand pane under the 
.. :showtitle: ... If this attribute is present, the document title displays at the top. If you remove it, the document title will not display on the page, but the homepage will still show the document title in the clickable list of all documents.

Asciidoc recommends putting one sentence on one line. In other words, don't use return when writing your text, no matter how long your sentence is going to be (and set your editor settings to show wrapping lines, since otherwise you'll have to chase looong sentences all the way across in your authoring software), and then just use a linefeed once for the end of a sentence, and twice for the end of a paragraph.

=== H3 How to Comment:

What follows is a comment that does not appear: (This is done by beginning a line with two // )

// This line does not appear.

What follows is a block of lines that do not appear. (This is done with four //// at the beginning of the first line and at the beginning of the line after the last block-comment.)
////
A block
of lines that do not
appear.
