## Overview

When a ProjectLiberty2029 administration takes power, there will be loyalists to the former MAGA regime who will attempt to thwart the rolling back of MAGA accomplishments. 

There will also be those who may be brought back into the fold of appropriate governance. 

There needs to be a consistent and quickly effective means for dealing with these individuals and collections of individuals. 

We must acknowledge that this situation is not a normal turnover from one civil-service administration to another.  

The document explores using the Japanese corporate practice of "oidashibeya" (oh-ee-dah-shee-beh-yah) to handle employees from the Authoritarian regime of DJT, MAGA and Project 2025 ("the MAGA regime") who remain in the Executive Branch. 

## Assignment to Banishment Rooms

Those assigned to Banishment Rooms are being assigned there in order to fulfill the tasks they will be given to serve the goals of the new President. 

### Criteria for Assignment to Banishment Rooms

Employees of the Executive Branch should be assigned to Banishment Rooms if they satisfy one or more of the following criteria:

. They willingly advanced policies of the MAGA regime that were probably illegal, 
. They willingly advanced MAGA policies that were deliberately cruel to humans,
. They willingly advanced policies of the MAGA regime using methods that were cruel to humans, 
. They refuse to repudiate the aforesaid MAGA regime policies and/or actions,
. They abused their authority,

### Activities of Employees Assigned to Banishment Rooms

Employees assigned to Banishment Rooms: (see the following section for discussion of ambiguities)

. Must not have edit privileges to government systems.
. Must perform their tasks, which should include:
.. Documenting and annotating their activities under the MAGA regime,
.. Documenting and annotating the activities of others under the MAGA regime,
.. Additional tasks relevant to documentation including taking polygraph tests,
.. Being "on call" to answer questions, where "on call" means they are in their banishment room and awaiting notification that there are questions for them to answer. 
. May take breaks and vacation and sick days as prescribed by Government policy.
. Must be in their assigned room at all other times during their work hours. 
. Should be assumed to be essential employees because of their unique knowledge of activities undertaken during the MAGA regime. 
. May not bring into the room their personal electronic devices unless approved by their supervisor the for the purposes of completing their tasks. 

To the maximum extent possible, those who have given notice must be required to report to their Banishment Room for debriefing for the maximum portion of their notice. The government should exercise all options to maximize debriefing time for exiting employees. 

## Definition of Banishment Rooms

Because a ProjectLiberty2029 administration must obey the Constitution, it must also obey the law. 

The authority to impose this procedure flows from the President, who has the right -- strengthened by the practices and legal battles of the MAGA regime itself -- to demand practices within the Administration which "align with the goals of the President." These are the boilerplate words used by the MAGA regime to fire people, where firing them was probably illegal. 

However, under Project Liberty 2029, the new administration will not fire these employees, it will assign them tasks. The assignment of work tasks is core to the duties and responsibilities of Executive Branch leaders. 

A Banishment Room will have the essentials for the primary task assigned to Banishment Room Employees: documenting the activities of the MAGA regime. 

. A desk, 
. A chair, 
. Daylight spectrum lighting that shall remain on at all times,
. A door that is locked from the outside but unlocked from the inside, allowing a person to leave for safety reasons,
. No windows, or if windows exist, they shall be obscured,
. A phone that only receives incoming government calls,
. A computer that:
.. has access to online resources only if they are essential for any tasks assigned to the employee, 
.. has an email account which can only send and receive from authorized government accounts, 
.. is key-stroke monitored
. A video camera and microphone that observes the employee at all times. 

## Probationary Rooms

Because all the criteria in the previous section involve a great degree of judgment, such decisions should be reviewed by at least one supervisor. 

However, there may be many ambiguous cases. For example, a supervisor may have worked against MAGA in cases involving cruelty, but with MAGA in cases involving financial policies of dubious wisdom but which may not be obviously illegal or cruel. Such a border-line supervisor may also offer cover in the evaluation of employees who reported to them.  

There should be therefore setup a Probationary Room, which represents a level of evaluation that has more room for re-incorporation of the employee into the full faith of the US Government. 

Such a room will be different from a Banishment Room in the following ways: 

. There will not be video and audio surveillance of the room.
. The phone will allow contact with the outside world, if such contact is normal in the employee's agency.
. The computer will have the same access to network resources as normal for that employee's position.
. The employee may bring their personal electronic devices unless denied by their supervisor. 

## Law enforcement

The information gained from documentation from tasks completed by employees in banishment rooms shall be given to law enforcement to preserve and to analyze in pursuing Justice for crimes committed by the MAGA regime.
