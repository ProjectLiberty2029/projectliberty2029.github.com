## aka, Fair and Share for We The People

_Lyrics by Vector Hasting, written to the tune of "Glory Hallelujah" composed by link:https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Steffe[William Steffe]_ +
_The Lyrical structure matches that of link:https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Julia_Ward_Howe[Julia Ward Howe's] poem "The Battle Hymn of the Republic"_

Mine eyes have seen the glory of a hope for fair reward +
To millions who now die to feed the wealth of overlords. +
Wake up our sleeping giant and draw out our fateful sword, + 
For Justice marches on. 
									
We feel the people power as our feet march on the land, +
We fight to stop the hatred and make cruelty disband. +
For shield against the powerful: the Share is our demand, +
For Justice marches on. 

_Fair and Share for We the People +
Fair and Share for We the People +
Fair and Share for We the People +
For Justice marches on._

We see a broken system that the rich have rigged to steal +
From poor and weak who only seek to beg an honest deal. +
The time has come to set it straight: a nation we must heal, +
For Justice marches on. +

The Share will build a power like an oceanic wave +
And wash away the fear that fills the Land of We the Brave. +
We lift our gaze to future days: our children we must save, +
For Justice marches on. 
								
_Fair and Share for We the People +
Fair and Share for We the People +
Fair and Share for We the People +
For Justice marches on._

The spark of Spirit born with us endows us to stand tall +
With Rights Inalienable to Dignity for all. +
The arc of history bends again and we must heed the call, +
For Justice marches on. +

In simple hope our ancestors were born across the sea +
Envisioning a future that improves for you and me. +
As they died to raise us higher, let us live to see us free, +
For Justice marches on. 					

_Fair and Share for We the People +
Fair and Share for We the People +
Fair and Share for We the People +
For Justice marches on._
