_Lyrics by Vector Hasting to the tune of "Yankee Doodle Dandy," composer unknown._
_Lyrical structure matches the traditional tune, writer unknown._

Yankee Doodle went to Vote +
A-riding on a pony, +
Stuck a feather in his cap +
And called it macaroni. +

_Chorus:_ 

_Yankee Doodle keep it up, +
Yankee Doodle Dandy, +
Mind the Music and the Vote, +
And 'round the town be handy._

Fath'r and I went down to vote +
Along with many millions, +
But there we found our vote don’t count +
As much as those with billions. +

_(Optional Chorus)_

Sister said it got this way +
Because of Gerrymander +
Some man who tied the polls in knots +
So he could play commander.

_Yankee Doodle keep it up, +
Yankee Doodle Dandy, +
Mind the Music and the Vote, +
And 'round the town be handy._

Our candidate was tell’n how +
Our system is so olden, +
We get to vote for only one, +
And so our country's stolen. +

_(Optional Chorus)_

She said a better kind o' vote + 
Was rankin' who we're good fer, + 
We mightn't get our number one, + 
But won't get stuck a loser. + 

_Yankee Doodle keep it up, +
Yankee Doodle Dandy, +
Mind the Music and the Vote, +
And 'round the town be handy._

The votin' line was awful long, +
I could not get no water, +
Some law said we must suffer so, +
Like lambs awaitin' slaughter. +

_(Optional Chorus)_

Missus Jane I saw her faint + 
Right in the heat beside us. +
She wouldn't go to hospital, + 
For fear of bankrupt-itus. +

_Yankee Doodle keep it up, +
Yankee Doodle Dandy, +
Mind the Music and the Vote, +
And 'round the town be handy._

Missus Jane she passed away, +
I saw her final breathing, +
Policemen came and said to go, +
Our vote was lost by leaving. +

_(Optional Chorus)_

Our candidate she lost the day, +
By just our Father's one vote, + 
The other guy we saw him wave +
From Mister Money's big boat. 

_Yankee Doodle keep it up, +
Yankee Doodle Dandy, +
Mind the Music and the Vote, +
And 'round the town be handy._

Mister Money says it's fine +
Our world is gettin' better, +
Father does not like to talk, +
He fears a pink-ish letter. +

_(Optional Chorus)_

I am just a little child, +
The world is big and fearful, +
I hope to help when I grow up, +
To make it all more cheerful. 

_Yankee Doodle keep it up, +
Yankee Doodle Dandy, +
Mind the Music and the Vote, +
And 'round the town be handy._
