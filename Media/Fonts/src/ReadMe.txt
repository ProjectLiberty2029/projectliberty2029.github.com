The Fonts here are open source, sil 1.0

They have had the Fair and Share tax glyphs added by Vector Hasting, which are deeded under CC 4.0 BY-SA

the .sfd files are the native files for the open source program Font Forge, last available here:

The meaning for these symbols are described under 
Legislation > The Share
  and
Legislation > Wealth Gap Reform

Unie021 is the "Tax Rate" symbol
Unie022 is the "Debt Target" symbol
Unie023 is the "Adjustment Rate" symbol
Unie024 is the "Share Percentage" symbol
Unie025 is the "Share Amount" symbol
Unie026 is the "Wealth Tax Rate" symbol
Unie027 is the "Wealth Gap Target" symbol

IMPORTANT NOTE: 

If you generate fonts with many of these "source" files, there will be a warning screen saying that there are errors, including intersecting paths, missing extrema, etc. 
You can ignore those warnings and get a perfectly workable font. 

It would be nice for someone with the interest to fix these files so that they don't issue that warning, but it is a low priority. 

Also note that there is no source file for "Libertinus" because we never created a share-glyphs-added version of that font. 

NOTE ON VS CODE:

Because Github integrates with VS Code, you may find it easier to edit docs inside that program. 

If you want access to the Fair and Share tax glyphs, the SourceCodeProShr files have these glyphs. 

To install them into VS Code: 

1) download the 4 font weights from /Media/Fonts/Spectral-Share* ;
2) install the font on your system ; 
3) In VS Code: go to File > Preferences > Settings > Text Editor > Font: and add 'Source Code Pro Share' (in quotes or single quotes)
4) Restart VS Code.
